Q. How this generated dataset will differ from real data?

Ans. This generated data will differ from real data in the following ways:

- Real world data will have a lot more user tracking metrics
- UserID in the real world is rarely a number. It must support a unique alphanumeric key generation for security.
- Not all data points may be captured in real world, so we will have some missing data.
  For instance, some values could be null or empty
- If data is generated using different timezones, it may lead to inconsistent results.
- Real world data may be prone to errors and duplicacy
